8. 当你原谅别人时，他们可能不会注意到，但你会痊愈的。宽恕不是我们为他人做的事；它是给自己的礼物。

10. 每当双方发生争执时，请找到第三方。
11. **效率被高度高估；愚蠢被高度低估**。定期安排的安息日、休假、假期、休息、漫无目的的散步和休假对任何类型的顶级表现都至关重要。**最好的职业道德需要良好的休息道德**。
12. 当你成为领导者时，你的真正工作是创造更多领导者，而不是更多的跟随者。
13. 私下批评，公开赞扬。
14. 生活的教训将按需要的顺序呈现给你。掌握教训所需的一切都在你内心。一旦你真正吸取了教训，你将获得下一个教训。如果你还活着，这意味着你还有教训要学。
15. 学生有责任从老师那里得到一切，老师有责任从学生那里得到一切。
16. 如果获胜在游戏中变得太重要，请更改规则使其更有趣。改变规则可以让它成为新的游戏。
17. 向投资人要钱，他们会给你建议；但征求建议，他们会给你钱。
18. 生产力往往会分散注意力。不要以尽快完成任务的好方法为目标，以让你永远不想停下来的**更好的任务**为目标。

25. 做艺术不是自私的，它是为我们其他人服务的。如果你不做你的事，就是在欺骗我们。
26. 永远不要询问女性是否怀孕。让她来决定是否告诉你。
27. 你需要的三件事：有能力不放弃一些东西直到它成功，有能力放弃一些不起作用的东西，以及相信他人来帮助你区分两者的区别。
28. 在公开演讲时，请经常暂停。在你以新的方式说话之前暂停，在说了一些你认为重要的事情后暂停，然后停下来作为缓和，让听众吸收细节。
29. 没有“准时”这种事情。你要么迟到了，要么早到了。请自行选择。
30. 问问任何你钦佩的人：他们的幸运突破发生在主目标的弯路上。所以拥抱弯路。生活对任何人来说都不是一条直线。

35. 在查看求职推荐信时，雇主可能不愿意或被禁止说任何负面的话，所以留言或发送消息给对方，上面写着：“如果这位求职者超级棒，您强烈推荐，请回复我。”如果他们不回复，就可以认为这是负面的。
36. 使用密码管理器：更安全、更简单、更好。
37. 接受教育获得的一半技能是了解什么东西是你可以忽略的。
38. 一个荒谬的雄心勃勃的目标的优势在于，它设定了很高的标准，即使在失败的情况下，以普通人的标准去衡量，它也可能是成功的。
39. 了解自己的一个好方法是认真思考别人身上让你恼火的一切事情。
40. 将所有物品都放在酒店房间里你能看到的地方，而不是抽屉里，并集中在一个地方。这样你就不会落下任何东西。如果你需要在旁边放一些像充电器之类的东西，在它旁边放一些其他大物品，比起一件物品，你不太可能落下三件物品。
41. 拒绝或回避赞美是不礼貌的。感激地接受它，即使你认为它不值得。
42. 始终阅读纪念碑旁边的牌匾。
43. 当你取得一些成功时，“冒名顶替”的感觉可能是真实的。我在愚弄谁？但是，当你创造了只有你——凭借你独特的才能和经验——才能做到的东西时，你绝对不是一个冒名顶替者。这是天注定的。你有责任做只有你才能做的事情。
44. 你在糟糕的日子里会做什么比你在好的日子做什么更重要。
45. 制作对人们有好处的东西。

48. 你不能让聪明人仅仅为了钱而努力工作。
49. 当您不知道为特定任务支付某人多少钱时，请问他们“多少钱”，他们的答案通常就是合理的。

51. You will be judged on how well you treat those who can do nothing for you.
52. 我们倾向于高估我们在一天内能做的事情，而低估了我们在十年内可以取得的成就。如果给你十年时间，奇迹是可以完成的。长期的比赛中，微小收益的复利甚至能战胜大的错误。
53. 感谢一位改变了你人生的老师。
54. You cant reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into.

59. 爬楼梯。

67. Art is whatever you can get away with.
68. 培养孩子想要取得最佳效果，只需要花一半你认为应该花的钱，但是付出两倍的陪伴他们的时间。
69. 购买你家乡或所在地区最新的旅游指南。每年游玩一次，你会学到很多东西。

71. 想快速揭示刚刚遇到的人的真实性格，请将他们转移到一个网速非常缓慢的环境里。然后观察。
72. 流行成功的处方：做一些奇怪的事情。让你的怪异成为一种习惯。
73. 专业精神就是备份你的备份。至少要有一个物理备份和一个云备份。然后再加倍备份。如果丢失了所有数据、照片、笔记，你会支付多少钱来恢复它们？与遗憾相比，备份更便宜。

77. 真正的好机不会在主题行就写着“好机会”。
78. 当被介绍给某人时，进行眼神交流，然后默数到 4。你们会互相记得双方。
79. 如果你发现自己想知道“我的好刀在哪里？或者，我的好钢笔在哪里？”这意味着已经拥有坏的那个。扔掉那些。

85. 你和那些能让你愤怒的东西一样大。
86. 与观众交谈时，最好将目光凝视在几个人身上，而不是将目光分散在房间里。你的眼睛会告诉别人你是不是真的相信你自己所说的。

89. 如果你再重复你今天所做的 365 天，明年你会成为你想成为的人吗？

12. When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.
13. Criticize in private, praise in public.
14. Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is within you. Once you have truly learned a lesson, you will be presented with the next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.

37. Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.
38. The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even in failure it may be a success measured by the ordinary.
39. A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.
40. Keep all your things visible in a hotel room, not in drawers, and all gathered into one spot. That way you’ll never leave anything behind. If you need to have something like a charger off to the side, place a couple of other large items next to it, because you are less likely to leave 3 items behind than just one.
41. Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks, even if you believe it is not deserved.
42. Always read the plaque next to the monument.

51. You will be judged on how well you treat those who can do nothing for you.
52. We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade. Miraculous things can be accomplished if you give it ten years. A long game will compound small gains to overcome even big mistakes.

54. You cant reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into.

66. Getting cheated occasionally is the small price for trusting the best of everyone, because when you trust the best in others, they generally treat you best.
67. Art is whatever you can get away with.
68. For the best results with your children, spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.

70. Dont wait in line to eat something famous. It is rarely worth the wait.
71. To rapidly reveal the true character of a person you just met, move them onto an abysmally slow internet connection. Observe.
72. Prescription for popular success: do something strange. Make a habit of your weird.
73. Be a pro. Back up your back up. Have at least one physical backup and one backup in the cloud. Have more than one of each. How much would you pay to retrieve all your data, photos, notes, if you lost them? Backups are cheap compared to regrets.

76. At a restaurant do you order what you know is great, or do you try something new? Do you make what you know will sell or try something new? Do you keep dating new folks or try to commit to someone you already met? The optimal balance for exploring new things vs exploiting them once found is: 1/3. Spend 1/3 of your time on exploring and 2/3 time on deepening. It is harder to devote time to exploring as you age because it seems unproductive, but aim for 1/3.
77. Actual great opportunities do not have “Great Opportunities” in the subject line.
78. When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other.
79. Take note if you find yourself wondering “Where is my good knife? Or, where is my good pen?” That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.
80. When you are stuck, explain your problem to others. Often simply laying out a problem will present a solution. Make “explaining the problem” part of your troubleshooting process.

82. Dont bother fighting the old; just build the new.
83. Your group can achieve great things way beyond your means simply by showing people that they are appreciated.
84. When someone tells you about the peak year of human history, the period of time when things were good before things went downhill, it will always be the years of when they were 10 years old — which is the peak of any human’s existence.
85. You are as big as the things that make you angry.
86. When speaking to an audience it’s better to fix your gaze on a few people than to “spray” your gaze across the room. Your eyes telegraph to others whether you really believe what you are saying.
87. Habit is far more dependable than inspiration. Make progress by making habits. Dont focus on getting into shape. Focus on becoming the kind of person who never misses a workout.
88. When negotiating, dont aim for a bigger piece of the pie; aim to create a bigger pie.

90. You see only 2% of another person, and they see only 2% of you. Attune yourselves to the hidden 98%.

94. Focus on directions rather than destinations. Who knows their destiny? But maintain the right direction and you’ll arrive at where you want to go.
95. Every breakthrough is at first laughable and ridiculous. In fact if it did not start out laughable and ridiculous, it is not a breakthrough.
96. If you loan someone $20 and you never see them again because they are avoiding paying you back, that makes it worth $20.
97. Copying others is a good way to start. Copying yourself is a disappointing way to end.
98. The best time to negotiate your salary for a new job is the moment AFTER they say they want you, and not before. Then it becomes a game of chicken for each side to name an amount first, but it is to your advantage to get them to give a number before you do.
99. Rather than steering your life to avoid surprises, aim directly for them.
100. Dont purchase extra insurance if you are renting a car with a credit card.
101. If your opinions on one subject can be predicted from your opinions on another, you may be in the grip of an ideology. When you truly think for yourself your conclusions will not be predictable.
102. Aim to die broke. Give to your beneficiaries before you die; it’s more fun and useful. Spend it all. Your last check should go to the funeral home and it should bounce.
103. The chief prevention against getting old is to remain astonished.
